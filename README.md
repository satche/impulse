# Impulse
A Unity game where the player position is defined by sent UDP packages

## About

Impulse is an academic project built in the context of the [MSE Computer Science](https://www.hes-so.ch/en/field-of-study/ia/mse/cs) program at [HES-SO](https://www.hes-so.ch/en). The goal is to create a game to encourage children with trunk problems to do exercises while having fun.

A belt attached to the player to determine their position (x, y, z) and orientation (yaw, pitch, roll). Data is sent through UDP packages to the game.
